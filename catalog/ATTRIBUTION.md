What was changed, by `scripts/build_catalog.py`:
- `stars.8.spc`: `data/stars.8.json` converted to the SPC1 binary format, right ascension moved
  from [-180, 180] to [0, 360), sorted brightest first. 52 stars with no B-V in the source
  were given 0.65.
- `star-names.json`: the proper names from `data/starnames.json` for those stars.
- `constellations.json`: the English names and label positions from `data/constellations.json`.
- `constellation-lines.json`: `data/constellations.lines.json` with right ascension moved to [0, 360).
